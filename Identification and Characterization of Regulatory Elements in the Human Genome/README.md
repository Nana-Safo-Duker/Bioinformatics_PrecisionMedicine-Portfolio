## 🎯 Overview

This project provides tools to identify regulatory elements in genomic DNA sequences using machine learning approaches. Regulatory elements are crucial DNA sequences that control gene expression, and their accurate identification is essential for understanding gene regulation, disease mechanisms, and developing therapeutic interventions.

### What Sequences Encode Regulatory Elements?

Regulatory elements are characterized by specific sequence patterns and features:

1. **Promoters**:
   - Located upstream of genes (typically 100-1000 bp from transcription start site)
   - Contain conserved motifs: TATA box (TATAAA), CAAT box (CCAAT), GC box (GGGCGG)
   - Initiator element (Inr): YYANWYY pattern
   - Downstream promoter element (DPE)
   - Specific nucleotide composition patterns

2. **Enhancers**:
   - Can be located far from genes (up to 1 Mb away)
   - Work in either orientation
   - Contain clusters of transcription factor binding sites
   - Often have high GC content
   - Characteristic chromatin accessibility patterns

3. **Silencers**:
   - Similar structural features to enhancers
   - Contain repressor binding sites
   - Often located in gene regulatory regions
   - May have specific sequence motifs for repressor proteins

4. **Insulators**:
   - Create boundaries between regulatory domains
   - Contain CTCF binding sites (CCCTC-binding factor)
   - Specific sequence patterns that block enhancer-promoter interactions
   - Often located between genes or regulatory regions

## 🔬 Features

### Feature Extraction

The project extracts multiple types of features from DNA sequences:

1. **K-mer Features**: 
   - Frequency of all possible k-mers (default: 3-mers/trinucleotides)
   - Captures local sequence patterns characteristic of regulatory elements
   - Normalized by sequence length

2. **Composition Features**:
   - Nucleotide frequencies (A, T, G, C)
   - GC content
   - AT/GC ratio
   - Dinucleotide frequencies (16 dinucleotides)
   - Sequence complexity (Shannon entropy)

3. **Motif Features**:
   - TATA box (TATAAA)
   - TATA box variants
   - CAAT box (CCAAT)
   - GC box (GGGCGG)
   - Other known regulatory motifs

### Machine Learning Models

The project implements and compares multiple ML models:

1. **Random Forest**: Ensemble method with feature importance analysis
2. **Gradient Boosting**: Sequential ensemble learning
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Kernel-based classification
4. **Neural Network (MLP)**: Multi-layer perceptron

### Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- AUC-ROC (Area Under the ROC Curve)

## 📊 Results

The analysis generates several visualizations:

1. **Model Comparison**: Bar chart comparing all models across different metrics
2. **ROC Curves**: Receiver Operating Characteristic curves for all models
3. **Confusion Matrices**: Detailed classification performance for each model
4. **Feature Importance**: Top features contributing to regulatory element identification

Results are automatically saved in the `results/` directory.
